### :rotating_light: BrowserBox on Tor!

#### üåç Enhanced Privacy with Tor Support

We are excited to announce that BrowserBox now supports Tor, providing you with a more private and secure browsing experience. This feature is still in alpha, but we're committed to continuously improving it to match the security level of the Tor Browser over time.

**Key Features:**
- **Onion Sites Accessibility**: Browse [`.onion`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion) websites seamlessly.
- **Privacy-First Browsing**: Enhanced encryption for anonymity and security. Tor conceals the IP address of your RBI server.
- **Socks5 Proxy Integration**: Traffic securely routed over a Socks5 proxy.
- **Simple Tor Activation**: Easy activation using the `--ontor` flag.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Tested on macOS and Debian.

#### :gear: Using BrowserBox with Tor

Activate Tor in BrowserBox with this command:

```shell
$ setup_bbpro <your-normal-args> --ontor
$ bbpro
```

*If you want to switch it off again, shut down as normal (`pm2 delete all`), and re-run `setup_bbpro` without the `--ontor` flag.*

Start exploring the web with Tor's added security.

#### :warning: Important Caveats and Commitment to Security

As this Tor integration is in *alpha*, there are several important considerations:

- **Proxy and Tor Escapes**: There's a potential for some requests to bypass the Socks5 Tor proxy or Tor itself, which could impact privacy. We are actively working to identify and mitigate these risks.
- **Adherence to Tor Guidelines**: We aspire to aligning our Tor integration as closely as possible with the best practices recommended by the Tor Project. This includes careful configuration to prevent leaks and maintaining the anonymity that Tor provides.
- **Ongoing Security Enhancements**: Our goal is to eventually provide a level of security comparable to the Tor Browser. We'll be regularly updating and improving the Tor functionality in BrowserBox.
- **Exploring Alternatives**: We are considering the integration of alternative browsers like Brave as the underlying engine for RBI, which may offer a more secure base than Chrome for Tor browsing.

#### :speech_balloon: Your Input is Valuable

Your feedback is crucial for our continuous improvement. Please report any issues or suggestions to enhance the Tor functionality on our GitHub issues page. Contributions, especially those that help achieve parity with Tor Browser's security, are highly appreciated.

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements in BrowserBox, and as always, enjoy a secure browsing experience!

### üöÄ Installable PWAs on Desktop

You can now install BrowserBox as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your desktop! This means smoother performance, offline capabilities, and a more integrated experience with your operating system. 

**Key Benefits:**
- **Seamless Integration:** Feel the power of a native app with the flexibility of a web application.
- **Offline Access:** Access essential features even without an internet connection.
- **Reduced Resource Usage:** Enjoy a more efficient use of system resources compared to traditional web browsing.

### üîó Protocol Links Support

Introducing protocol links support with `web+bb://`. Now, you can open links directly in BrowserBox by prefacing them with `web+bb://`. This feature allows for more efficient navigation and a streamlined process to access web content.

**How it Works:**
- Simply prefix your URL with `web+bb://`.
- For example, to open `https://example.com`, use `web+bb://https://example.com`.
- The link will automatically open in BrowserBox, providing a seamless browsing experience.

This update is part of our ongoing commitment to enhance BrowserBox and make your web experience as efficient and enjoyable as possible. Try out these new features and let us know what you think!

Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, happy browsing with BrowserBox!

## Docker Quick Start :gem: *Version 6*

**November 4 2023**: New version released. Docker image v6.

First ensure you have docker installed and running! :) Then run:

```console
PORT=8080 # or your preferred port
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/f2162a8553c0f91068127bd3063eaf2fdc4d005d/deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh) $PORT

# *Special Event!* ü§ô Create a private ephemeral Web Proxy hosted on your GitHub Actions minutes by opening an issue on this repo

**HOLD UP** You need to [fork](../../fork) or [generate](../../generate) this repo first, so you have your own copy. Then open an issue and you will be guided through the process (1 manual step, rest is automatic), while your browser VPN is created. 

By default they remain open for 5 minutes, but you can make that longer by editing the workflow YAML file. Each minute used counts against your GitHub actions quota. Also, don't do anything abusive with this, remember you are browsing the web from inside GitHub's infrastructure (actions runners), so treat them with respect!

Limitations: no audio, no DevTools, no docviewer (Because the ports are not accesible, although the services are running)

## Zero Trust Installation Guide

**üåü Video Installation Guide for Pro: [https://youtu.be/cGUJCCPDWNE](https://youtu.be/cGUJCCPDWNE)**

For detailed information and progress updates, please refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/dosyago/BrowserBox).

## Installation

Follow these instructions to install BrowserBoxPro on your system.

### Initial Machine Setup

Before installing BrowserBoxPro, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- Debian VPS with 1 cores, 1 GB RAM, and 25 GB SSD (e.g. Nanode from Linode)
- At least 5 Mbps internet connection
- A public hostname with a DNS A record pointing to your VPS's IP address, or localhost certificates installed on your local and remote machine (for example using [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert))

First, update your distribution:

`apt update && apt -y upgrade`

And install a few basic tools:

`apt install curl git wget`

Now, prepare the machine by following these steps:

1. Create a new user to operate BrowserBoxPro:
   ```
   adduser pro
   ```

2. Disable the password for the newly created user:
   ```
   usermod -L pro
   ```

3. Create a new group for sudo privileges:
   ```
   addgroup sudoers
   ```

4. Add the following line to the sudoers file to avoid entering a password for sudo operations:
   ```
   %sudoers ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
   ```
   Use the `visudo` command to edit the sudoers file.

5. Grant sudo privileges to the user:
   ```
   usermod -G sudoers pro
   ```

Switch to the `pro` user by executing the following command:
```
sudo -u pro bash
```

### Installation Process

Follow these steps to install BrowserBoxPro:

1. Clone the BrowserBoxPro repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dosyago/BrowserBoxPro
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd BrowserBoxPro
   ```

3. Run the global installation script, replacing `<domain_name>` with your domain name that points to the machine you're setting up (if you want to use it without a domain name, just use localhost here for the domain name, but you'll still need to copy the correct mkcert localsthost certificates to $HOME/sslcerts later):
   ```
   ./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh <domain_name>
   ```

4. Start the main service on port 8080 and generate the login link:
   ```
   setup_bbpro --port 8080
   ```

5. Launch BrowserBox:
   ```
   bbpro
   ```

During the installation process, BrowserBoxPro will automatically install the required dependencies and configure the necessary settings.
